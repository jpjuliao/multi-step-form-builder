== Changelog ==

= 1.1.1 =
* **Display Conditions**:
    *   Added a modal trigger button shortcode and setting to open forms on click.

= 1.1.0 =
* **Performance & Architecture**:
    *   Implemented **Code Splitting** using `React.lazy` and `Suspense` to reduce initial bundle size for both Admin and Frontend.
    *   Added **Dynamic Imports** in entry points (`src/admin/index.js`, `src/frontend/index.js`) to load chunks on demand.
* **Frontend Refactoring (`src/frontend`)**:
    *   **Architecture**: Adopted a Service-Repository pattern for API calls (`services/api.js`) and Custom Hooks for logic separation.
    *   **Custom Hooks**: Created `useFormConfig` for data fetching and `useMultiStepForm` for form state management.
    *   **Component Composition**: Decomposed `MultiStepForm.js` into single-responsibility components: `StepContent`, `FormNavigation`, `FormFeedback`, and `Spinner`.
    *   **Dependency Optimization**: Removed heavy `@wordpress/components` dependency; implemented lightweight local `Spinner` using existing CSS.
* **Admin Refactoring (`src/admin`)**:
    *   **Component Decomposition**: Refactored monolithic `StepEditor.js` into composed children: `StepHeader`, `StepFieldsList`, and `StepFieldAdder`.
    *   **Optimization**: Applied lazy loading to Admin tabs and heavy editor components.
